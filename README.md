## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started">Chat Application </a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: You should have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as React is based on these technologies.

Knowledge of React: You should be familiar with the basics of React, such as components, state, props, and lifecycle methods.

Git API knowledge: You should have knowledge of the Git API and its features, such as creating and managing repositories, issues, and pull requests.

OtherAuth knowledge: You should have knowledge of OAuth and how to implement it in your React app to allow users to authenticate with the Git API.

Real-time messaging knowledge: You should have knowledge of real-time messaging technologies such as WebSocket, Socket.io, or Firebase, to implement real-time messaging between users.
Testing knowledge: You should have knowledge of testing frameworks such as Jest and Enzyme to test your React components and the overall functionality of your chat application.

Deployment knowledge: You should have knowledge of deploying a React application to a hosting service such as Netlify or Heroku.

Keep in mind that these are the basic prerequisites, and the exact knowledge required may vary depending on your specific requirements and the complexity of your chat application.
### Installing
Installing the  HTML CSS  react Extension install in vs code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://github.com/durgeshgiri123/Chat-App) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://github.com/durgeshgiri123/Chat-App) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests">
Install testing dependencies: Install the required testing dependencies using npm or yarn. Jest is the default testing framework that comes with create-react-app.
  Using command:-  npm-start 
Run the tests: Run the tests using the testing framework's CLI. For example, to run the Jest tests, you can run the following command:
 npm-test also.

### Break down into end to end tests

End-to-end (E2E) testing is a type of testing that verifies the behavior of your application from start to finish. In the context of a chat application using React, E2E testing can include testing the user interface, the interaction with the Git API or real-time messaging technology, and any other functionality that is crucial to the user experience.

## üéâ Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement">
Delivered status: You can display a delivered status icon or message when a message has been successfully sent and received by the server. This can provide assurance to the sender that the message has been successfully delivered to the recipient's device.

Read status: You can display a read status icon or message when the recipient has read the message. This can provide feedback to the sender that the message has been seen and read, and reduce uncertainty about whether the recipient has received the message.

Typing status: You can display a typing status indicator when the recipient is typing a reply. This can provide real-time feedback to the sender that the recipient is actively engaged in the conversation.

Notification sounds: You can play notification sounds when a new message is received, providing an audible cue that a message has arrived.
